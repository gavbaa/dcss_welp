This wasn't what I wanted at all. What sort of sick fucks would do this to all these people? They looked defenseless. This isn't the work of some frilled lizard, they're just opportunistic carrion eaters. I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta

Two months ago, sitting at my desk grinding through another meaningless pivot table, listening to my favorite true crime podcast, I was just Norman the accountant. The podcast's normal mid-episode interruption cut in, for the Stone Soup Caves, about an hour south of here. The hosts went on and on excellent spelunking, some beautiful natural underground terrain, and honestly I couldn't even remember the last time I went on an adventure. College? Ugh, college was over a decade ago. I could use something to shake things up. I wasn't the most experienced spelunker, but I wasn't a complete stranger to caves either, this wouldn't be hard.

Had to do a fair bit of shopping, as a desk job hasn't been kind to the fit of any of my previous gear, and I'll be damned if I'm going to look like a bratwurst in khaki shorts on my way in. I even did some Stairmaster work in case there was a lot of elevation changes, and honestly because I couldn't go more than a mile without gasping.

I arranged for the next door neighbor to check in on Norman, my cat, so that I had the ability to camp overnight. Early that Saturday, I packed the car, slapped the trunk for good measure, and headed off for the caves before the sun came over the horizon.

What a gorgeous entrance, these guys were right. This place is everything I hoped for. I got lucky and no one else was here. Silent except for the dripping into the slowly running water.

My new headlamp sliding forward on my brow, I found a side path and went exploring.

And then it all went wrong. I found a weird little path and a clearly manmade stone altar at the center. You don't see a lot of artifacts in caves like this anymore, they're usually picked over long before the public gets to them.

I thought this was a myth, a boogeyman for children so they wouldn't Bloody Mary in a mirror. Who would build an altar to this heinous monster? This is some sick cult shit.

I'm out. Fuck this place. Time to retrace my steps.

I panicked and got turned around trying to get away from that thing. And that's when I found... them. These poor people. I need to get the police down here now.

Oh goddammit, who are you? WHAT ARE YOU?
